Recycling: A comprehensive solid waste recycling program that includes packing material, paper, cardboards, scrap metal, and hazardous e-waste has been established among campus residents. Biogas: Wet waste on campus is used as feedstock for a bio digester which supplies cooking fuel for the student dining hall. The vegetable peelings and food residue, which are generated in the dining hall, canteen, and residential areas will be degraded in the digester to produce biogas which will be then sent back to the dining hall kitchen. This will reduce our fossil fuel consumption. The biosolid that is generated as a part of the digestion process will be converted to compost at our Resource Recovery Park."

            "Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) is a premier institute of science and technology established in 2008. IITH has been consistently ranked in the top 10 institutes in India for Engineering according to NIRF making it one of the most coveted schools for science and technology in the country. IITH offers undergraduate programs in all the classical engineering disciplines, applied sciences, design, as well as several modern interdisciplinary areas. Students are given a flexibility to explore a broad set of areas, and potentially pursue a minor or double major in a discipline that is not their own. Students who wish to seek a deeper understanding of their own discipline are strongly encouraged to get involved in cutting-edge research with the help of a faculty to mentor them, and earn an Honors in their own field. The very foundation of IIT Hyderabad is based on research and innovation. The vibrant research culture is evident from the number of patents and publications that IITH produces consistently every year. IITH offers graduate programs at both a masters, and a doctoral level, in several diverse areas. There are separate programs for technology, design, science, and liberal arts. The MTech program is offered in various modes and durations to cater to the ever-growing need of postgraduate level professionals in the country. IITH encourages and supports innovation and entrepreneurship at every stage. The minor program in entrepreneurship is open to all students of IITH, and many of the courses are offered by industrialists who are entrepreneurs themselves. There are various innovation centers and incubators that promote entrepreneurship and help mentor young innovators. IITH has been very successful in building tie-ups with leading academic institutions around the globe. IITH enjoys a very special relationship with Japanese universities and industries that goes beyond academic and research collaborations.

            "Dear Friends, Welcome to Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. We are proud of preparing dynamic leaders, who make a difference to the world, with the skills that are nurtured here for a better tomorrow. As an institute that has completed only 11 years of its existence, it is gratifying to note that we are doing well and are almost on par with some of the first generation IITs. With the NIRF ranking of 8 among all the engineering institutes in the country and with QS Asia BRICS ranking of 94, we stand tall. This is essentially due to over 200 dynamic young faculty of the institute with an average age of 39, who work hard and take up challenges without the fear of failure, making IITH at the forefront of R&D innovations. A healthy faculty to student ratio of 1:14 and a good mix of UG and PG program with UG to PG to PhD ratio of 40:30:30, makes IITH a unique place for teaching and research. The strong research culture at IITH is reflected from around 500 sponsored research projects of Rs. 220 Crores that our faculty members have been handling currently. The number of Scopus indexed publications in the last 5 years are above 6000, which again reflects the thriving research activity. With a strong Japanese collaboration and the support from Ministry of Education, the second phase infrastructure development is in its full swing and is expected to be completed by 2022. This is expected to give a big push to the research activity of the institute. IITH has a strong start up culture with dedicated space for incubation and research park. By the end of second phase we will have about 1.2 lakh sft of space each for the above two activities, which will boost the entrepreneurship activity significantly. The fractal academics with interdisciplinary approach, with departments such as AI, Climate Change, Engineering sciences provide a unique academic atmosphere at IITH. The BTech program in AI, a minor in entrepreneurship, Executive MTech in Data Science together with the Design and Liberal Arts departments represent the unique and diversified academic fabric. MTech in E-Waste Management & Recycling (together with C-MET) and Energy are some of the new programs being planned from the next academic year, which will add value to the existing academic program. The campus life is improving on various fronts. The newly introduced mentoring of the students by faculty and alumni is expected to pump in positive energy into students’ lives. We have now a 24x7 hospital on the campus along with the support by specialist doctors visiting the campus regularly. The new supermarket, the 24x7 Nescafe and Amul outlet have made the life of the campus residents better. We are looking forward to strong collaborations, both academic and industrial, to help us grow stronger. Industry-R&D-Academia tie up on cutting edge technologies is the key for the growth of the country. IITH will play its part proactively in the near future in this direction. Wishing you all a very happy and",

            "The design philosophy of the logo is based on the two key words ‘Inventions and Innovations’, the foundation and vision of IIT Hyderabad. It is depicted using two i’s with common dot above them. These letters emanates outwards on either directions signifying expansion and growth of that knowledge. This reflects the core values of the institute where it fosters and facilitates in expanding ones intellectual ability, creativity, research and scientifi c discoveries. The identity is a symbolic representation of a person reading a book. This indicates imparting knowledge through quality education. The logo has also been envisaged with another deeper and philosophical meaning. The circle in the logo depicts the sun, the primary source of energy. The portrayal of sun symbolizes guiding light, force, creation, growth and strength. The warm and radiating colour scheme is derived from the vibrant sunlight (which also reflects the geographical climate of the city).

            "Dear Friends, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) welcomes you to the Dream Destination of Future Industry, Academic & Innovation leaders where each one enthusiastically endeavours our efforts towards our motto – Inventing & Innovating in Technology for Humanity (IITH). We are proud of preparing dynamic leaders who make a difference in the world with the skills that are nurtured here for a better tomorrow. We elegantly entered into our Crystal Year (15 years) and it is gratifying that we are doing almost on par with some of the first-generation IITs in many respects. With the NIRF ranking of 9 among all the engineering institutes and 14th overall rank in the country, and within the top 10 technical institutes from India in QS world rankings, we stand tall. This is essentially due to over 300+ dynamic young faculty of the institute in over 18 departments, with an average age of about 39, who work hard and take up challenges without the fear of failure, making IITH at the forefront of R&D innovations. A healthy faculty-to-student ratio of 1:14 and a good mix of UG and PG programs with a UG:PG:PhD ratio of 42:30:28 makes IITH a unique place for teaching and research. The strong research culture at IITH is reflected in 2,207 sponsored research projects of Rs. 877+ Crores that our faculty members have been handling. The number of Scopus-indexed publications in the last 5 years is close to 5,128, reflecting the thriving research activity. With a strong support to innovation, IITH has more than 190 patents and has incubated 125+ startups in the last 5 years, which have created 1000+ jobs and Rs. 800+ Cr revenue. IITH has a strong start-up culture with a dedicated space of about 1.5 lakh sqft for incubation and a research park, the department of Entreprenuership & Management and the School of Innovation & Entrepreneurship (being established by Cyient Foundation). With strong Japanese collaboration and support from the Ministry of Education, the second phase of infrastructure development is in full swing and is expected to be completed by July 2023. This is expected to give a big push to the institute's research activity. The fractal academics with an interdisciplinary approach, with departments such as AI, Climate Change, Engineering sciences, and interdisciplinary PhD, provide a unique academic atmosphere at IITH. The BTech program in AI, Biomedical Engineering, Biotechnology & Bioinformatics, Industrial Chemistry and Computational Engineering, IC Design & Technology (most of them being 1st introduced among the IIT system), a minor and double major in entrepreneurship, Executive MTech in Data Science, and the Design and Liberal Arts, Heritage Science & Technology departments represent the unique and diversified academic fabric of IITH. The institute has taken up several industryoriented measures this year. A semester-long internship in the 6th semester for BTech/BDes students and a mandatory 1-credit course on “Industry Lectures” are to name",
            "& Technology (most of them being 1st introduced among the IIT system), a minor and double major in entrepreneurship, Executive MTech in Data Science, and the Design and Liberal Arts, Heritage Science & Technology departments represent the unique and diversified academic fabric of IITH. The institute has taken up several industryoriented measures this year. A semester-long internship in the 6th semester for BTech/BDes students and a mandatory 1-credit course on “Industry Lectures” are to name a few. At least 50% of MTech projects will be on industry-defined problems from now on. A number of new industry-oriented MTech programs such as Additive manufacturing (with DRDO support), E-waste resource engineering & management (jointly with C-MET, Hyderabad, and with the MEITY support), Medical device innovation (jointly with AIG, Hyderabad), Energy science & technology, Integrated sensor systems, Network & information security, Polymers & biosystems engineering and Smart mobility, will enhance our outreach to industry. We have also introduced Online MTech in Data Science, Microelectronics and VLSI, Communications and Signal Processing, Power Electronics and Power Systems, Heritage Science & Technology, Computational Mechanics, Industrial Metallurgy, Integrated Computational Materials Engineering and EV Technology, along with an Online MDes, so that working professionals can also boost their academics and perform well in their field of interest. In order to further support the working professionals, we have waived off the residential requirement for external PhD program. We look forward to strong academic and industrial collaborations to help us grow stronger. IndustryResearch-Academia ties upon cutting-edge technologies are the key to the country's growth. I am confident that IITH will play its part proactively in this direction. We are looking forward to a strong and long-standing collaboration! Stay Safe & Stay Strong…"

The companies, comprising startups, SMEs, and large corporates, participated in promoting their businesses/cutting-edge technologies to attract students from IITH. 6th Edition of Japan Day concluded at IIT Hyderabad Highlights: 20 Japanese entities participated in the event, the maximum number till date Entities ranging from Established firms to Entrepreneurs have shown keen interest in IITH students To enhance the strong bond between Japan and IITH, Japan Day has expanded to Japan Week, where academic and cultural aspects were also introduced 7 Japanese universities and 3 Japanese government organizations participated in the Academic Day held on 18th September 2023 Three technical workshops for hands-on-demonstration of sophisticated scientific equipment were held in collaboration with Japanese companies Culture and Tourism Day was organized on the 23rd of September, in which 4 Japanese organizations and 1 hub participated to showcase Japanese culture Expressing his delight on the occasion, Mr Toshihiro Mizutani, Director General, JETRO Bengaluru, said, “Interest in India's engineering and scientific talent is growing among Japanese companies; as a result, we are welcoming double the number of Japanese companies as compared to last year's Japan Day. Since there is a critical lack of IT engineers in Japan, several businesses there are eager to employ motivated Indian expertise. The participating Japanese companies anticipate that IITH students will play key roles in emerging technological innovation and global strategies. Former “JAPAN DAY” has now expanded to “Japan Week” to showcase other aspects, including Japanese culture. We hope that the students explore a little about Japanese culture and also gain some essence of the Japanese corporate culture.” Read More... Office of Career Services"
